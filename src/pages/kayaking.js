          the past, many participants who didn’t know how to swim have kayaked
          with us & enjoyed it thoroughly!

        </div>

        <p className="lead left">Q) What to wear?</p>
        <p className="content">
          A) Wear comfortable clothes – t-shirts, shorts, track pants are some
          of the comfortable options. If possible, wear a full sleeves t-shirt
          to avoid sunburns. Avoid jeans or cotton t-shirts as these tend to
          stay wet for long. If possible, choose quick dry clothes. For
          footwear, choose flip-flops, water sandals or paddling shoes.
          Basically anything that is water proof and light.
        </p>
        <p className="lead left">Q) How tiring is kayaking as an activity?</p>
        <p className="content">
          A) Kayaking is similar to trekking. We keep moving at a constant pace
          and take break time to time. Moving in water is more efficient than
          land. To cover the same distance, kayaking takes less energy than
          trekking. It is an excellent workout for the upper body.
