      <p className="lead left"> When to visit:</p>
      <p className="content">
        If you want to do an intro to scuba program or an Open Water course, you
        can come at any time of the year. The sites that you visit as part of
        these programs are accessible year long and not that significantly
        affected by weather (tides and phase of the moon play a bigger role). Do
        keep in mind that unlike mainland monsoons, rainy season in the Andamans
        typically means frequent short showers – only occasionally do we have
        long, heavy rains (and that too, usually at night). So you can still
        have a very enjoyable holiday here, even in the monsoons.
      </p>
      <p className="content">
        For certified divers, the traditional peak dive season in the Andamans
        has been from December to May – the sun is (usually!) shining, the seas
        are flat and visibility is at its best during this period. June and July
        are monsoons – this means that some days, the seas are very rough and we
        cannot go very far. Other days, it is calm and sunny, and the diving is
        surprisingly good.
      </p>
      <p className="content">
        The September to November period is becoming the “hidden season” when it
        comes to scuba diving in the Andamans – yes, there are occasional to
        regular rains, and the seas are marginally choppier than what it would
        be in March or April, but the fishlife is mindboggling – enormous
        schools of fish occupy your entire vision, turtle and manta sightings
        are common and the reefs buzz with excitement and action. All our dive
        staff agree that the diving during this period is the best that they’ve
        ever done in their years in the Andamans. So if you are interested in
        really primo diving, but without crowds and with the moderate risk of
        being limited in the choice of dive sites due to weather, consider
        coming in this time period.
      </p>
      <p className="content">
        In the past few years, June has not had a lot of rains and has pretty
        much become an extension of the peak season. August is a bit of an
        unusual month – it has been raining a little more than normal the past
        few years, but the seas haven’t been too rough, and the diving has been
        very good at this time. For advanced divers, it is likely to be hit or
        miss – the diving is superb, but we may not be able to visit our
        highlight deep sites at this time.
      </p>

      <p className="content">
        A word of warning, however: weather conditions are becoming more and
        more erratic these days, and we are having more “nice days” in the
        so-called off-season and more “rough days” in the peak season. The above
        is meant to be indicative, based on recent trends, but we really have no
        way of predicting the impact of climate change.
      </p>
      <p className="content">
        <b>Travel tip:</b> Please check weather forecast before you start your
        journey to andamans and depending on that, you may have to pack some
        rain wear.

      <p className="lead left">Permits and Visas:</p>
      <p className="content">
        All foreign visitors to India need a visa. No special permits are
        required to visit andamans after recent modifications made by the Govt
        of India.
      </p>
      <p className="content">
        Indian passport holders do not need any permits to visit the Andamans.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="lead left">Getting to the Andamans:</p>
      <p className="content">
        The quickest and most convenient way to get to the Andamans is to fly.
        Sea route is reserved for the more patient as it takes 3-4 days
        depending on the weather. If you want to come directly to Havelock on
        the day of your arrival, taking a flight that arrives in Port Blair
        before 1200hrs would give you time to catch the last ferry to havelock
        that usually leaves at around 1400hrs.
      </p>

      <p className="content">
        If you want to come directly to Neil on the day of your arrival, please
        make sure you land by 1000hrs in order to catch the 1100 ferry.
      </p>

      <p className="content">
        For the return, if your outbound flight is after 1300hrs, you can come
        back from Havelock or Neil on the same morning quite easily. If your
        outbound flight is before 1300hrs, you will need to spend the last night
        in Port Blair.
      </p>

      <p className="content">
        <b>Note:</b> Please check with us the ferry timings before you finalize
        your travel plan.

      <p className="lead left">PORT BLAIR TO HAVELOCK TO PORT BLAIR::</p>

      <p className="content">
        Along with the government, there are multiple ferry operators that
        operate between Port Blair and Havelock (Swarajdweep).
      </p>

      <p className="content">
        If you land in Port Blair by 12:00pm, you can take the last ferry to
        Havelock. Otherwise, you have to spend the first night in Port Blair,
        and then take the morning ferry the next day.
      </p>

      <p className="content">
        For the return, if you have a flight after 1330, you can take one of the
        morning ferries back to Port Blair on the same morning. Otherwise, you
        need to go back one day prior, and spend the last night in Port Blair.
      </p>

      <p className="content">
        It is possible to arrange these tickets when you arrive (and Makruzz
        tickets can also be bought online). However, for guests staying and
        diving with us, we offer (and strongly recommend that you avail of) a
        Meet and Greet facility which includes airport pickup, ferry tickets
        to/from Havelock and all land transfers (airport to hotel/jetty, hotel
        to jetty, etc). Please contact us for pricing and to book this.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="lead left">Reaching our Dive center:</p>
      <p className="content">
        Our dive center is conviniently located close to the Jetty. Once you
        come out of the jetty, a short 5 minute walk towards the Number 3 market
        will take you to our dive center. We are located to the right hand side
        when you are coming from jetty and you can find us right opposite Virgin
        Beach Resort.

      <br />
      <p className="lead left">Where to stay in Port Blair and Havelock:</p>
      <p className="content">
        Now a days, most of the properties are listed online. You can find them
        on most of the hotel booking portals. For suggestions on where to stay,
        feel free to get in touch with us on Whatsapp.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="lead left">Health:</p>

      <p className="content">
        There is one Primary Health Center, one private pharmacy in havelock and
        a good public hospital in Port Blair. So it is recommended that you
        bring preferred or prescription medication with you since the options on
        the islands are very limited.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="lead left">What to bring:</p>

      <p className="content">
        Most of the Andamans operate on cash, with a few of the bigger hotels
        (and us) taking debit/credit cards. So, we suggest that you carry
        sufficient cash with you during your visit to the islands. There are a
        quite a few ATMs in Port Blair and 3 ATMs in Havelock which cannot
        always be relied upon (Very often do you see tourists standing in long
        queues to withdraw cash from an ATM because thats the only ATM which is
        working at that point of time)
      </p>

      <p className="content">
        Certified divers should bring their C-card and logbook. Divers insurance
        is a good idea to have as well – we strongly recommend coverage sold by
        Divers Alert Network (DAN). Also, if you are doing a scuba course and
        have any pre-existing medical conditions, you will need a doctor’s
        clearance. Please download the Medical Statement here or contact us for
        a copy, and complete it, along with a doctor’s clearance, before
        bringing it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="lead left">Mobile networks:</p>

      <p className="content">
        Indian residents please note - BSNL is considered to be the best of the
        worst on the islands ( Airtel and Vodafone have decent coverage in Port
        Blair and in a few places in Havelock) however, data connectivity is
        pretty much non-existent, except for slow GPRS on BSNL.

      <p className="lead left">Safety:</p>
      <p className="content">
        As long as you take the basic precautions – i.e., don’t leave your
        valuables lying around, don’t entrust your cash to strangers, etc., you
        should be fine. There is virtually no violent crime in the Andamans,
        especially against tourists.
      </p>
      <p className="content">
        Same applies for single female travellers. Havelock and Neil are very
        safe places, and there isn’t much to worry about in terms of assault,
        harassment, etc.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="lead left">Language:</p>
      <p className="content">
        Pretty much everyone on the islands can speak Hindi along with one or
        two other regional languages and most of them understand English. So, be
        assured that communication isn't going to be a problem on these islands.
